A fun and interactive game in which **You're an alien-zombie**.
In order to survive on Earth, you have to pretend to be a human on this planet. You took over the body of a nearby hooman, but the trouble is, their best friend showed up!
They look suspicious. Answer the questions right to make sure your identity is kept secret!
